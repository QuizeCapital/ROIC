# Quantitative Investment Research (Systematic Quintile Equity Investment Strategies) : Return On Invested Capital (ROIC) as a single factor strategy

## Overview

"Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States require that the recogn tion of expenses be matched to the period in which the associated revenues are recognized, whenever it is practical to do so. For example, a company may pay for nails, wood, glue, and labor to make furniture now but not recognize those expenses on the income statement until the furniture has actually been sold. This is called accrual accounting, because expenses are accrued on the balance sheet but not charged to income until the related revenues are recognized.6 Because of the inherent timing difference between cash basis accounting and accrual basis accounting, and because of the greater potential for accounting sleight of hand with accrual basis accounting, investors also look at a companyâ€™s cash flow to determine its profitability. Operating cash flow for a period shows the actual cash inflows and outflows that occurred during the period and were related to operating activities. Although operating cash flow is more volatile than accounting earnings, it is also harder to fake.
Cash flow from operating activities less cash needed to maintain and expand plant and equipment (capital expenditures) is referred to as free cash flow, since this amount represents cash available to pay dividends, expand the business, repurchase shares, and so on. Growth in free cash flow is a key indicator looked at by many investors to gauge the underlying profitability of a corporation."

This repository is home to files used in conducting a 5 level Quintile Research where i try to determine the relationships between the Earnings per share growth and free cash flow per share of specific quintiles.Quintiles here is defined by splitting relevant data (first factor) eg. market value, free cash flow per share, earnings per share etc. into a number of portfolios which is used as reference for our second factor.
