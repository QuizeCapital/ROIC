## `Codes`

In this directory, I store two code files of this research project. One for datasets download and the other for
the actual project. Both codes were written in python.

***Data Extraction Code***

The code utilises a class function which consists of child functions that 
call both local and global variables .

The parent class function is called the 'Datasets' function where we set our global variables : 

The subfunction of parent class is called the 'getCleanedDatasets' function.This functions siphons raw datasets from financial modelling prep mainly historical price, ROIC and S&P data(quarterly and annually) .Takes global attributes of class and out puts a json file with cleaned datasets for each subfunction containing either fundamental item.

The 'getCleanedROICData', 'getCleanedHistoricalPriceData', 'getCleanedSandPHistoricalData', 'getCleanedAnnualMarketCapData', 'Surprise' under the 'getCleanedDatasets' function connects to financial modelling prep's Api
and gets eps, fcfpcs, price, fcf, and earnnings surpise data from various sections as bulk data. Takes original ticker data as parameter and returns returns each tickers data.

***Analysis Code***
