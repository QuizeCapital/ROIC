## `Codes`

In this directory, I store two code files of this research project. One for datasets download and the other for
the actual project. Both codes were written in python.

***Data Extraction Code***

The code utilises a class function which consists of child functions that 
call both local and global variables .

The parent class function is called the 'Datasets' function where we set our global variables : 

The subfunction of parent class is called the 'getCleanedDatasets' function.This functions siphons raw datasets from financial modelling prep mainly historical price, ROIC, marketcaps and S&P data(quarterly and annually) .Takes global attributes of class and out puts a json file with cleaned datasets for each subfunction containing either fundamental item.

The 'getCleanedROICData', 'getCleanedHistoricalPriceData', 'getCleanedSandPHistoricalData', 'getCleanedAnnualMarketCapData', 'getCleanedQuarterlyHistoricalPriceData','getCleanedSandPQuarterlyHistoricalData' under the 'getCleanedDatasets' function connects to financial modelling prep's Api
and gets marketcap , ROIC, historical price, S&P data(both quarterly and annual) from various sections as bulk data. 

The 'getCleanedQuarterlyHistoricalPriceData' function extracts daily historical prices, calculates
the return  and converts them into the quarterly mean  quarterly returns

***Analysis Code***

The function 'splitDfYears' calls the openJson function from the UniversalModules class. It takes the return on invested capital data and returns a list of dataframe grouped by year.

The 'quintiledROIC' function takes the quintiled ROIC data and returns a lsit of dictionaries containing year as key and tickers of five quintiles as values
